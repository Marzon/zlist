== ZList ==

ZList is a simple yet powerful mailing list application and is built on Rails.  It can
send mail to an unlimited number of recipients, can be configured as announcement only
or it can be fully interactive.  Subscribers can view and reply entirely by email, or 
via the web interface.  All discussions are archived so you can go back anytime to see
what was said.

It accepts email piped from an MTA (we use Postfix) and can accept email for an entire
domain or specified addresses.
